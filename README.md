â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ config.js        # Configuration file for MongoDB connection
â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/     # Controllers for handling different routes
â”œâ”€â”€ models/          # MongoDB models
â”œâ”€â”€ routes/          # Route definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json     # Node.js project configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ server.js        # Entry point of the server
â””â”€â”€ README.md        # Readme file for project documentation
4. Usage:
Controllers: Controllers in the controllers/ directory handle the business logic for various routes.
Models: MongoDB models in the models/ directory define the structure of data stored in the database.
Routes: Route definitions in the routes/ directory specify the endpoints and their corresponding controller methods.
Server: server.js is the entry point of the server, where Express is initialized and routes are mounted.
